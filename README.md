##Food Nutrition Look-up

This is a react client app borrowed from this tutorial: https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/how-to-get-create-react-app-to-work-with-your-rails-api/

I've modified it to fetch from a totally separate Rails api (it's not nested within the rails app as in the referenced tutorial). I've also modified the display table to accomodate a couple more nutrients. The extra nutrients needed to be added by adding json keys in the food model in the api. The rails api code is here: [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

This project was bootstrapped with [Rails api demo](https://github.com/jpalm/rails_api-endpoint_demo).
